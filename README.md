The code and information for my raspberry pi security camera

## What this taught me
* Introduction to coding in Linux
* First rpi project
* Use of rpi camera module
* Using motion on an rpi
* Hosting a webserver off of an rpi

## This expanded my knowledge on

## How it works
1. The program views the feed from the camera
1. When the camera detects motion it informs the program
1. The program begins recording 
1. When the camera stops detecting motion it informs the program
1. The program stops recording
1. The program saves the video locally and uploads the file Dropbox if this setting is enabled

I did this project because I wanted to introduce myself to raspberry pi and using Linux, python and pi modules effectively together to make something interesting and useful for someone in their daily lives
