# Raspberry-Camera
The code and information for my raspberry pi security camera

## What this taught me
* Introduction to coding in Linux
* How to use OpenCV
* Using Dropbox in python
* Introduction to projects using a Raspberry Pi
* Using Raspberry Pi modules such as the camera module

## This expanded my knowledge on
* Using JSON in python

## Images

## How it works
1. The python program views the feed from the camera
1. When the camera detects motion it informs the python program
1. The python program begins recording 
1. When the camera stops detecting motion it informs the python program
1. The python program stops recording
1. The python program saves the video locally and uploads the file Dropbox if this setting is enabled

## Why I did this project
I did this project because I wanted to introduce myself to raspberry pi and using Linux, python and pi modules effectively together to make something interesting and useful for someone in their daily lives
